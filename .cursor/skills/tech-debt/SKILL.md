## Phase 1: Parse Subcommand

Determine the mode from the argument:

- `scan` — Scan the codebase for tech debt indicators
- `add` — Add a new tech debt entry manually
- `prioritize` — Re-prioritize the existing debt register
- `report` — Generate a summary report of current debt status

If no subcommand is provided, output usage and stop. Verdict: **FAIL** — missing required subcommand.

---

## Phase 2A: Scan Mode

Search the codebase for debt indicators:

- `TODO` comments (count and categorize)
- `FIXME` comments (these are bugs disguised as debt)
- `HACK` comments (workarounds that need proper solutions)
- `@deprecated` markers
- Duplicated code blocks (similar patterns in multiple files)
- Files over 500 lines (potential god objects)
- Functions over 50 lines (potential complexity)

Categorize each finding:

- **Architecture Debt**: Wrong abstractions, missing patterns, coupling issues
- **Code Quality Debt**: Duplication, complexity, naming, missing types
- **Test Debt**: Missing tests, flaky tests, untested edge cases
- **Documentation Debt**: Missing docs, outdated docs, undocumented APIs
- **Dependency Debt**: Outdated packages, deprecated APIs, version conflicts
- **Performance Debt**: Known slow paths, unoptimized queries, memory issues

Present the findings to the user.

Ask: "May I write these findings to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`?"

If yes, update the register (append new entries, do not overwrite existing ones). Verdict: **COMPLETE** — scan findings written to register.

If no, stop here. Verdict: **BLOCKED** — user declined write.

---

## Phase 2B: Add Mode

Prompt for: description, category, affected files, estimated fix effort, impact if left unfixed.

Present the new entry to the user.

Ask: "May I append this entry to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`?"

If yes, append the entry. Verdict: **COMPLETE** — entry added to register.

If no, stop here. Verdict: **BLOCKED** — user declined write.

---

## Phase 2C: Prioritize Mode

Read the debt register at `docs/tech-debt-register.md`.

Score each item by: `(impact_if_unfixed × frequency_of_encounter) / fix_effort`

Re-sort the register by priority score and recommend which items to include in the next sprint.

Present the re-prioritized register to the user.

Ask: "May I write the re-prioritized register back to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`?"

If yes, write the updated file. Verdict: **COMPLETE** — register re-prioritized and saved.

If no, stop here. Verdict: **BLOCKED** — user declined write.

---

## Phase 2D: Report Mode

Read the debt register. Generate summary statistics:

- Total items by category
- Total estimated fix effort
- Items added vs resolved since last report
- Trending direction (growing / stable / shrinking)

Flag any items that have been in the register for more than 3 sprints.

Output the report to the user. This mode is read-only — no files are written. Verdict: **COMPLETE** — debt report generated.

---

## Phase 3: Next Steps

- Run `/sprint-plan` to schedule high-priority debt items into the next sprint.
- Run `/tech-debt report` at the start of each sprint to track debt trends over time.

### Debt Register Format

```markdown
## Technical Debt Register
Last updated: [Date]
Total items: [N] | Estimated total effort: [T-shirt sizes summed]

| ID | Category | Description | Files | Effort | Impact | Priority | Added | Sprint |
|----|----------|-------------|-------|--------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| TD-001 | [Cat] | [Description] | [files] | [S/M/L/XL] | [Low/Med/High/Critical] | [Score] | [Date] | [Sprint to fix or "Backlog"] |
```

### Rules
- Tech debt is not inherently bad — it is a tool. The register tracks conscious decisions.
- Every debt entry must explain WHY it was accepted (deadline, prototype, missing info)
- "Scan" should run at least once per sprint to catch new debt
- Items older than 3 sprints without action should either be fixed or consciously accepted with a documented reason

<!-- PHASE2_DEEPENING_BEGIN -->
## Phase 2 — Skill deepening (Cursor Game Studios)

### Rich procedural spine (`tech-debt`)

Treat this skill as a **flight checklist**, not a vibe. Each invocation should
end with: **inputs read → actions taken → artifacts produced → risks noted**.

### Spawn template (copy/paste starter)

```text
You are executing the Cursor Game Studios skill `tech-debt`.

Constraints:
- Collaboration protocol: question → options → decision → draft → approval.
- Prefer diffs and tests as evidence.
- If MCP is available, use it only for verification or deterministic automation.

Task:
<describe the concrete outcome you want>
```

### MCP gate requirements

| Gate | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **G0** | Story/design references exist or explicit “greenfield” declaration |
| **G1** | File targets identified (paths) before bulk writes |
| **G2** | Tests or review plan named before “done” claims |
| **G3** | If engine MCP is used, mutations are **serialized** (no parallel writes) |

If a gate is missing, **stop** and ask for the minimum artifact to proceed.

### Worked example (skeleton)

1. **Locate** the governing doc or story file.
2. **Extract** acceptance criteria verbatim.
3. **Plan** the smallest change set that satisfies them.
4. **Implement** with incremental commits (human-triggered).
5. **Verify** with the narrowest test that proves the criteria.

### Common failure modes and recovery

| Failure | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| Scope creep mid-flight | Cut a “phase 2b” story; ship the slice |
| Missing ADR / GDD link | Write a one-paragraph decision stub, then link |
| Flaky verification | Stabilize test data; reduce parallelism |
| Tool timeouts | Fall back to local commands; shrink batch size |

### Skill evolution path

- **v1:** checklist fidelity (this repo)
- **v2:** add engine-specific exemplars in `skills/` reference tree
- **v3:** wire optional MCP “verify steps” where safe
